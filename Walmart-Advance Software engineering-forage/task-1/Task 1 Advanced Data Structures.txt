Task 1: Advanced Data Structures

Your task is to implement a novel data structure - your project lead is calling it a power of two max heap. The rest of your team is doing their best to come up with a better name. The requirements of the data structure are as follows:

# >$ The heap must satisfy the heap property.
# >$ Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.
# >$ The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor.
# >$ The heap must implement an insert method.
# >$ The heap must implement a pop max method.
# >$ The heap must be implemented in Java.
# >$ The heap must be performant.
# >$ You must use a more descriptive variable name than x in your implementation.

Think carefully about how you implement each method, and manage the underlying data. Performance is critical, so keep cycles and memory usage to a minimum. Be sure to test your heap with very small and very large values of x. As always, keep a weather eye out for sneaky edge cases.
